# gridlab
A suite of maxforlive monome devices

Developed for Berklee ISEL-P112 Grid Performance Studies 

This collection of devices is currently under active development and in pre-beta status. Really, at this point I'm using github to synchronize my personal development systems and not really to publicaly distribute stuff.

Principles
* Optimised for 128-format grids, although other grid sizes and multiple-monome configurations will be supported
* Varibright monome required
* Utilizes sync via Ableton Live Link - by default, devices should stay in phase with the transport
* Autofocus with LED state cacheing
